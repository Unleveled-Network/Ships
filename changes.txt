v1.0,1 change log

Update to Forge v1291
Added new ship block textures by useless_one!
Ship block properties are much more user friendly now
 * Server log shows if properties are loaded, and how many
 * added server command to list overridden block properties
 * added server command to query properties for specific blocks
 * entries now look like: minecraft:planks=1;1;true;true;false
Fixed a bug with ship collision that was causing massive lag in mid-to-far lands
Restructured GUIs to stop acting like inventory GUIs
 * This keeps inventory related overlays from covering the GUIs
Restructured core mod to be more friendly to non-standard Minecraft environments/launchers
Switched to dynamically managed entity IDs to improve inter-mod compatibility
